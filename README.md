## Description

This is a procon plugin (for games like Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline). When enabled, the plugin will automatically kick any player that is not included in the reserved slots list. In other words, it lets you turn your publicly ranked game server into a private match at any time (without the need for a game password)!
